Based on input type:**\n\n1. Single Document, where the input length is short. Many of the early summarization systems dealt with single document summarization.\n\n2. Multi Document, where the input can be arbitrarily long.\n\n**ii. Based on the purpose:**\n\n1. Generic, where the model makes no assumptions about the domain or content of the text to be summarized and treats all inputs as homogeneous. The majority of the work that has been done revolves around generic summarization.\n\n2. Domain-specific, where the model uses domain-specific knowledge to form a more accurate summary. For example, summarizing research papers of a specific domain, biomedical documents, etc.\n\n3. Query-based, where the summary only contains information which answers natural language questions about the input text.\n\n**iii. Based on output type:**\n\n1. Extractive, where important sentences are selected from the input text to form a summary. Most summarization approaches today are extractive in nature.\n\n2. Abstractive, where the model forms its own phrases and sentences to offer a more coherent summary, like what a human would generate. This approach is definitely a more appealing, but much more difficult than extractive summarization.","metadata":{"_uuid":"a603f52d84bce68c606a8ba684f08908e935d812"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.

We can find the weighted frequency of each word by dividing its frequency by the frequency of the most occurring word.\n\n### 6.5 Replace Words by Weighted Frequency in Original Sentences\n> The final step is to plug the weighted frequency in place of the corresponding words in original sentences and finding their sum. It is important to mention that weighted frequency for the words removed during preprocessing (stop words, punctuation, digits etc.) will be zero and therefore is not required to be added\n\n### 6.6 Sort Sentences in Descending Order of Sum\n> The final step is to sort the sentences in inverse order of their sum.
