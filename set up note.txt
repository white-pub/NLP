=>Create a New Repository on GitHub
=>Clone the Repository Using GitHub Desktop
        stored the project on your local machine under C:\Users\...Github\folder name

=>Navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned
        cd path_name
=>Create a Virtual Environment named venv
        python -m venv venv
=>Activate the virtual environment (on Windows)
    🎀-----------------------🎀
        venv\Scripts\activate
    🎀-----------------------🎀
        should see the (venv) in cmd

=> Stay in the virtual environment, start installing needed packages


🍧Option 1:use requirement.txt

    ----
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ----
    This command installs all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file with the specified versions.

🍧Option 2: install packages manually through pip

Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries

spaCy

    Using pip, spaCy releases are available as source packages and binary wheels. Before you install spaCy and its dependencies, make sure that your pip, setuptools and wheel are up to date. 
    (from spaCy documentation- https://spacy.io/usage)

    pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
    pip install -U spacy

nltk
(For stopwords and other NLP utilities)

    pip install nltk

scikit-learn
(alternative for removing stopwords])

    pip install scikit-learn

  Save the installed packages to a requirements.txt file
    
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    
    🐦It's a good practice for future reference!
